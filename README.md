Hi there! My name is Dillon.
I'm a Computer Science student at Washington State University.
I am currently at Junior level in CptS classes, but I've switched majors a few times so I've got a lot of credits.
Since 2018, I've taken classes in neuroscience, anthropology, bioengineering, and various other engineering disciplines. Plenty of math too.
Currently I do research with the Driskell lab in the School of Molecular Biosciences. Topics in bioinformatics, AI, ML, and data visualization interest me. 
My hobbies include reading/writing, gaming/game dev, piano, and learning languages (currently Japanese).
