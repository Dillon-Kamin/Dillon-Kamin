Hi there! My name is Dillon.
I'm a Computer Science student at Washington State University.
I am currently at Senior level in CptS classes, but I've switched majors a few times so I've got a lot of credits.
Since 2018, I've taken classes in neuroscience, anthropology, bioengineering, and various other engineering disciplines. Plenty of math too.
I am currently not in research, but topics in bioinformatics, AI, ML, and data visualization interest me. 
My hobbies include bouldering, reading/writing, chess, gaming/game dev, piano, and learning languages (currently Japanese). 
I also hold a volunteer position as the Managing Editor of the Palouse Review, a scholarly and creative journal which publishes work by honors students.
