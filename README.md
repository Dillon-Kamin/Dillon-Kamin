Hi there! My name is Dillon.
I'm a Computer Science student at Washington State University.
I am currently at Sophomore level in CptS classes, but I've switched majors a few times so I've been in college for a while.
Since 2018, I've taken classes in neuroscience, anthropology, bioengineering, and computer engineering. As well as plenty of math, of course.
Research in bioinformatics, AI, ML, and graphics interest me.
My hobbies include game development, piano, reading/writing, and learning languages (currently Japanese).
