Hi there! My name is Dillon!
I'm a Computer Science student at Washington State University.
I am currently at Sophomore level in CptS classes, but I've switched majors a few times so I've been in college for a while.
Game dev is currently my largest are of interest, but I also dabble with hardware programming and computational mathematics.
